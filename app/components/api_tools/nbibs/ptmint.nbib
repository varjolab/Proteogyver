AB  - MOTIVATION: Post-translational modification (PTM) is an important biochemical 
      process. which includes six most well-studied types: phosphorylation, 
      acetylation, methylation, sumoylation, ubiquitylation and glycosylation. PTM is 
      involved in various cell signaling pathways and biological processes. Abnormal 
      PTM status is closely associated with severe diseases (such as cancer and 
      neurologic diseases) by regulating protein functions, such as protein-protein 
      interactions (PPIs). A set of databases was constructed separately for PTM sites 
      and PPI; however, the resource of regulation for PTM on PPI is still unsolved. 
      RESULTS: Here, we firstly constructed a public accessible database of PTMint 
      (PTMs that are associated with PPIs) (https://ptmint.sjtu.edu.cn/) that contains 
      manually curated complete experimental evidence of the PTM regulation on PPIs in 
      multiple organisms, including Homo sapiens, Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis 
      elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and 
      Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Currently, the first version of PTMint encompassed 
      2477 non-redundant PTM sites in 1169 proteins affecting 2371 protein-protein 
      pairs involving 357 diseases. Various annotations were systematically integrated, 
      such as protein sequence, structure properties and protein complex analysis. 
      PTMint database can help to insight into disease mechanism, disease diagnosis and 
      drug discovery associated with PTM and PPI. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: 
      PTMint is freely available at: https://ptmint.sjtu.edu.cn/. SUPPLEMENTARY 
      INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
